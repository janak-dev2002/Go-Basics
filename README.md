# Go-Basics — README

Short guide and automation to include Go-related files and directory contents into this README.

## Purpose
Collect a brief project overview and automatically append listings that include only Go-related items (.go, go.mod, go.sum, and tests).

## Recommended layout
- Project overview
- Getting started / build & test
- Formatting / linting
- Per-directory sections with Go file listings and short notes

## Quick commands to append only Go-related files
Replace the path with your target directory (example: I:/My Drive/Life_RoadMap/Power_Resources/Go/guide_project/Go-Basics).

- Unix / Git Bash / WSL (find — lists only go files and module files):
```bash
echo -e "\n## Go files in Go-Basics\n" >> README.md
find "I:/My Drive/Life_RoadMap/Power_Resources/Go/guide_project/Go-Basics" -type f \( -name "*.go" -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "go.sum" \) | sed 's|^|- |' >> README.md
```

- If using tree (Git Bash / WSL) and tree supports -P:
```bash
echo -e "\n## Go files in Go-Basics\n" >> README.md
tree -a -L 2 -P '*.go|go.mod|go.sum' -I '.git|node_modules' "I:/My Drive/Life_RoadMap/Power_Resources/Go/guide_project/Go-Basics" >> README.md
```

- PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
Add-Content README.md "`n## Go files in Go-Basics`n"
Get-ChildItem -Path "I:\My Drive\Life_RoadMap\Power_Resources\Go\guide_project\Go-Basics" -Recurse -File -Include *.go,go.mod,go.sum |
    Sort-Object FullName |
    ForEach-Object { Add-Content README.md ("- " + ($_.FullName -replace '\\','/')) }
```

## Common Go commands (include these in Getting started)
- go mod init <module>
- go mod tidy
- go build ./...
- go test ./...
- go vet ./...
- go fmt ./...

## Template for per-directory section (Go-focused)
```markdown
### <Directory Name> (relative/path)
Short description of Go purpose for this directory (packages, cmd, tests).

Files:
- main.go — program entrypoint (if present)
- package.go — implementation and exported APIs
- helper_test.go — unit tests for package
- go.mod — module definition (top-level)
- go.sum — dependency checksums (auto-generated)
```

## Notes
- The commands append raw listings filtered to Go-related files. Edit README.md to add descriptions and organize sections afterward.
- Provide a list of directories to include and a short note for each if you want a ready-to-paste, annotated README.
